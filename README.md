# Hookless Benchmarks

[![Build status](https://github.com/robertvazan/hookless-benchmarks/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/robertvazan/hookless-benchmarks/actions/workflows/build.yml)

[JMH](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) benchmarks for [Hookless](https://hookless.machinezoo.com/) reactive programming library.

Latest results are archived in [JMH JSON file](https://cdn.machinezoo.com/jmh/hookless-benchmarks.json).
They can be visualized on [jmh.morethan.io](https://jmh.morethan.io/?source=https://cdn.machinezoo.com/jmh/hookless-benchmarks.json).

## Status

Experimental. [Stagean](https://stagean.machinezoo.com/) is used to track progress on class and method level. This is a stub project. Thorough testing of Hookless would require many more benchmarks.
